## üéØ Architecture Summary

The app follows a clean, modular architecture:

1. **Expo Router** for file-based navigation (type-safe routes)
2. **React Native Paper** for UI components (Material Design 3)
3. **Firebase** for authentication and push notifications
4. **i18next** for Arabic localization
5. **TypeScript** for type safety (strict mode)
6. **Environment-based config** for secure Firebase credentials

All text and layouts are RTL-optimized, and the Firebase configuration is environment-based for security. The project structure is modular and scalable, ready for future feature expansion like:

- Offer details screen
- User profile management
- Real-time notifications via FCM
- Favorites/bookmarks
- Search and filtering
